The project contains 4 subprojects- DiffApiCore is the main asp.net core web api project,
DAL contains classes for database using entity framework database first approach and also
other classes for comparing data. APITest is unit test project and contains test for testing
controller methods. APIIntegrationTest contains integration tests.
I also created script for creating database and it will of course needed to change the path where the database will be created.
Tests both unit and integration need to be executed in order like they are written in test class because they
use data from database. I tested it and they were all passing.
Before I wrote tests I tested application with postman and responses were correct.
